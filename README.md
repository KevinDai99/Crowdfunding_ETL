# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this project, I demonstrate the extract, transform and load process. What this refers to is the cleaning of data (extraction/transformation). In particular, the cleaning techniques I focused on is:

1) Regex (regular expression) for extracting certain string patterns.
2) Transforming the datasets (i.e. removing columns, and merges)

In the second part, I loaded the cleaned datasets into a SQL database and assigned primary and foriegn keys as outlined in the sketch.
I have also included the code I used to create the tables.
